				Imagine a field full of purple bugs that are wandering around and eating grass. 
				If a bug finds enough to eat, it will eventually reproduce and create a new bug. 
				But, if a bug can't find enough to eat, it will die of starvation. 
				This image shows a picture of the bugs in the field. 
				The green squares are patches of grass that can be eaten by the bugs. 
				If a square is white, the grass has already been eaten and is in the process of re-growing.

				<br/>
				For the following questions, you will use a computer simulation that models the relationship between the 
				bugs and the grass that they eat. To use the model, first click the setup button. Click on the Play/Pause 
				button to see the bugs move around the world, eat grass, and reproduce. The model will run for 1000 steps before 
				ending. You can run it again by clicking the Setup button again followed by the Play/Pause button. 
				To the left of the simulation is a graph showing the total number of bugs and the total amount of grass.

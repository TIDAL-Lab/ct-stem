TODO:
	- Add student info export logic
	- add assessment dropdown fro 'thanks for submitting' page so it is easy to take another assessment

Small
	- Issue w/ lots of empty records gettings saved before an actual record
	- images disappear when going backwards in CPS1
	- get a new URL (ct-stem.northwestern.edu/assess/....) -> update google analytics after doing this
	- Next is hidden on login page (sometimes)
	
 Medium
	- bring tortoise UI more inline w/ NetLogo
	- add logic for duplicate assessments - if a student already has a record for that assessment - put in an interstitial page asking 'are you sure?'

 Large
	- make a question object in the DB that joins to reponses in DB
	- upgrade to django 1.6 (so you can use the emailInput widget)

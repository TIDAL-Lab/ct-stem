	- get a new URL (ct-stem.northwestern.edu/assess/....)
	- add logic to track what version of climate change model was used (primary vs. secondary)

  - make the js version of the climate change model the primary one - but figure out how to embed it only once

	- make a question object in the DB that joins to reponses
	- move assessment name, short name, and html file name into an object (as opposed to hard coded in a few places)
